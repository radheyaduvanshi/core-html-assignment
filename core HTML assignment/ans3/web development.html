    <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1><hr>
    <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a range of tasks, from designing the user interface to coding the functionality and ensuring that the website works smoothly. <br><br>Here are some key aspects of web development:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Front-End Development:</b> Front-end development, also known as client-side development, focuses on the user interface and user experience of a website. Front-end developers use technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create the visual elements of a site that users interact with directly.</li>
        <li><b>Back-End Development:</b>Back-end development, also known as server-side development, deals with the server-side logic and database management that power websites and web applications. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.</li>
        <li><b>Full-Stack Development:</b>Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development. They can handle the entire web development process, from designing the user interface to writing server-side code and managing databases.</li>
        <li><b>Web Frameworks:</b> Developers often use web frameworks to streamline development and ensure best practices. Popular frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development and Django, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js for back-end development.</li>
        <li><b>Responsive Design:</b>Building websites that are responsive and mobile-friendly is crucial, as users access websites on a variety of devices and screen sizes. This involves using flexible layouts and CSS techniques to adapt content to different screen sizes.</li>
        <li><b>Version Control:</b> Developers use version control systems like Git to track changes to code, collaborate with other developers, and manage project versions effectively.</li>
        <li><b>Testing and Debugging:</b>Rigorous testing and debugging are essential to ensure that websites and web applications function correctly. Developers use testing frameworks and tools to identify and fix issues.</li>
        <li><b>Deployment and Hosting:</b>Developers must deploy websites to web servers and ensure they are accessible to users. This involves configuring servers, managing domain names, and selecting appropriate hosting solutions.</li>
    </ul>
